    "    \n",
    "It looks scary. I understand. For years, if I saw a line like that, I would ignore it and find some other way to solve my problem. The key to reading regex is to recognize its components.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's start by ignoring the `result = ...` assignment part and focus on `re.match...` part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a call to `re.match(expression, string)` to look for `expression` in string where `expression` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    r\"(?P<feet>[0-9]+)'(?P<inches>[0-9]{0,2}?)[\\\"]?\\Z\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "and `string` is `prime_str`, the argument passed to the inches function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re.match ()` function  is described in detail here (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.match). It looks for `expression` in `string`. Let's break down the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `r` signifies that the rest of the expression will be in raw notation (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#raw-string-notation), eliminating the need to use a silly amount of backlash escape characters. \n",
    "2. The next chunk is `(?P<feet>[0-9]+)`. The parentheses signify that everything inside them should be extracted as a \"group\" we can access later. Inside it, we see `?P<feet>`, which stores the group under a symbolic name we can use to access it later. The actual pattern portion is `[0-9]+` The brackets signify that any character is a valid match. In this case, the numerals 0-9 are all valid. The `+` signifies that there needs to be at least one of these values.\n",
    "3. The next chunk is the `'` prime mark (actually a single quote). There has to be one.\n",
    "4. The next chunk is `(?P<inches>[0-9]{0,2}?)`. It looks a lot like the chunk to extract feet. The only differences are that we are storing the result under a different symbolic name \"inches\" and instead of `+` we have `{0,2}?`. Remember the `+` means look for at least one occurrence, but we don't want to require inches. Instead the `?` means to look for exactly 0 or 1 occurrences of the `[0-9]` pattern (any numeral). Putting `{0,2}?` means look for 0 to 2 numerals, but not more. That's because we don't want to accept strings like 5'120.\n",
    "5. The next chunk `[\\\"]?` looks for zero or one double prime (double quotation mark), since the trailing double prime is optional according to our spec.\n",
    "6. Finally, the `\\Z` matches the end of the string. We don't want to allow any trailing characters, like 5'6LOL"
